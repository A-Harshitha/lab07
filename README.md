## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Unzip the `lab07` Folder

Unzip the `lab07` folder to your desired location. For example, you might unzip it to `C:\Users\YourUsername\Projects\`.

### 2. Navigate to the `lab07` Directory

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `lab07` directory:
```bash
cd path\to\lab06
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment named `venv` inside your `lab07` directory:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 5. Install Flask and SQLAlchemy

Install Flask using pip:
```bash
pip install Flask
